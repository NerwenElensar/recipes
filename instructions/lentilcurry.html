      </li>
      <li>
        Place the lentils in a saucepan with 6 cups warm water. Bring to a low boil, then boil
        for about 20 minutes until tender (taste to assess doneness). Drain, then add a few
        pinches of salt
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, wash the greens, remove the stems and chop the leaves. (If using prewashed
        baby spinach, you can skip this step.) In your largest skillet, heat the olive oil over
        medium high heat. Add the greens and saut√© for several minutes until tender and bright
        green.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the lentils are done, add them to the skillet with the greens. Over medium high
        heat, stir in the coconut milk, Thai red curry paste, tomato paste, kosher salt, and
        fresh ground black pepper. Cook for a few minutes until heated through and the sauce is
        thickened.
      </li>
      <li>Taste and add a few pinches of salt if desired. Serve with rice.</li>
    </ol>
